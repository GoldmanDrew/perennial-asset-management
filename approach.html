      <h3>Approach</h3>
      <div class="card">
        <h2>Separately managed accounts</h2>
        <p>
          Perennial Asset Management manages client capital through separately
          managed accounts (SMAs). Each client maintains a brokerage account in
          their own name, granting us discretionary authority to invest
          according to our strategy.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Full transparency into holdings and activity</li>
          <li>Assets remain in the client’s custody at a third-party broker</li>
          <li>Taxable events are visible at the individual account level</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="two-col">
        <div class="card">
          <h2>Research and decision-making</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Bottom-up:</strong> We build our portfolio one business at a
              time, based on fundamental research.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Concentrated:</strong> We typically hold a focused group of
              high-conviction investments, rather than hundreds of small
              positions.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Long-horizon:</strong> Our default holding period is measured
              in years. Activity is driven by changes in intrinsic value or
              price, not by market noise.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="muted small">
            Patience is a competitive advantage. We are comfortable doing very
            little when prices and opportunities do not meet our standards.
          </p>

        <div class="card">
          <h2>Alignment and incentives</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>The Portfolio Manager invests personal capital alongside clients.</li>
            <li>We aim to keep our structure simple and our fees transparent.</li>
            <li>We measure success over rolling five- to ten-year periods, not quarters.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="muted small">
            Our objective is to treat clients’ capital with the same care and
            attention as we do our own.
