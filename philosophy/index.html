      <div class="card">
        <h2>Business owners, not stock traders.</h2>
        <p>
          We approach every investment as if we are buying a piece of a private
          business, not a trading symbol. Our goal is to grow our partners’
          wealth through the power of long-term compounding while avoiding
          permanent loss of capital.
        </p>
        <p class="muted small">
          We would rather own a handful of outstanding businesses for many
          years than trade frequently in businesses we understand less well.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="two-col">
        <div class="card">
          <h2>What we look for</h2>
          <p class="muted small">Common patterns across our investments:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Durable competitive advantages</li>
            <li>High returns on invested capital</li>
            <li>Aligned, capable, and honest management</li>
            <li>Reinvestment opportunities at attractive returns</li>
            <li>Purchase price with a margin of safety</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="muted small">
            We favor simple, understandable businesses that can compound value
            for long periods of time.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h2>How we think about risk</h2>
          <p>
            Risk is not volatility. Risk is the permanent impairment of capital.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>We use conservative assumptions and focus on downside first.</li>
            <li>We avoid leverage at the portfolio level.</li>
            <li>We only invest within our circle of competence.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="muted small">
            Our quantitative background helps us size positions, understand tail
            outcomes, and maintain discipline under uncertainty.
