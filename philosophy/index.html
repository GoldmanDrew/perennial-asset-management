      <h3>Philosophy</h3>

      <div class="card">
        <h2>The business-owner mindset</h2>
        <p>
          We invest as long-term business owners. Every holding is
          evaluated on its economics, competitive advantages, management,
          and long-term prospects. Our objective is to compound our partners’
          capital over decades while minimizing the risk of permanent loss.
        </p>
        <p class="muted small">
          We prefer a handful of outstanding businesses held for long periods of
          time rather than frequent trading or excessive diversification.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="two-col">

        <div class="card">
          <h2>What we look for</h2>
          <p class="muted small">Common traits across our investments:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Durable competitive advantages</li>
            <li>High returns on invested capital</li>
            <li>Reinvestment opportunities at attractive rates</li>
            <li>Aligned, capable, and honest management</li>
            <li>Purchase price below intrinsic value</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="muted small">
            We favor simplicity, durability, and long-term economic resilience.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h2>How we think about risk</h2>
          <p>
            Volatility is not risk. True risk is the permanent impairment of capital.
            We pay close attention to downside scenarios, balance sheet strength, and 
            the predictability of long-term cash flows.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>We size positions conservatively</li>
            <li>We avoid leverage at the portfolio level</li>
            <li>We stay within our circle of competence</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="muted small">
            Our quantitative background helps us understand tail outcomes, convexity, 
            and portfolio resilience under uncertainty.
          </p>
        </div>

      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h2>Opportunistic investments and selective use of options</h2>
        <p>
          While our core is long-term ownership of high-quality businesses, we remain
          flexible and opportunistic. We pursue <strong>special situations</strong> where the 
          risk–reward is unusually asymmetric—such as spinoffs, recapitalizations, 
          dislocations, or forced selling that creates temporary mispricing.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may also use options <strong>selectively and conservatively</strong> when they offer
          a clear structural advantage: either to add <strong>right-tail convexity</strong> at 
          favorable prices or to <strong>mitigate downside risk</strong> without introducing 
          leverage. Options are opportunistic tools, not a trading strategy.
        </p>
        <p class="muted small">
          These opportunities are pursued only when well-understood and complementary 
          to our long-duration core holdings.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h2>Alignment and incentives</h2>
        <p>
          We believe compensation should only be earned when clients prosper.  
          Accordingly, we charge <strong>no management fees</strong>.
        </p>
        <p class="muted small">
          This structure aligns our incentives directly with our clients: we win 
          only when they do.
