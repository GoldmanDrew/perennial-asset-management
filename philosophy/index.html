      <h3>Philosophy</h3>
      <div class="card">
        <h2>Business owners, not stock traders.</h2>
        <p>
          We approach every investment as if we are buying a piece of a private
          business, not a trading symbol. Our goal is to grow our partners’
          wealth through the power of long-term compounding, while striving to
          avoid permanent loss of capital.
        </p>
        <p class="muted small">
          We would rather own a handful of outstanding businesses for many
          years than constantly trade in and out of names about which we have
          little conviction.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="two-col">
        <div class="card">
          <h2>What we look for</h2>
          <p class="muted small">
            While each investment is unique, most share a common pattern:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Durable competitive advantages and strong business economics</li>
            <li>Capable, aligned, and honest management teams</li>
            <li>Reinvestment opportunities at attractive incremental returns</li>
            <li>Purchase price that embeds a meaningful margin of safety</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="muted small">
            We prefer businesses that can grow intrinsic value over time
            without requiring heroic assumptions or constant financial
            engineering.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h2>How we think about risk</h2>
          <p>
            Risk, to us, is not short-term volatility. It is the possibility of
            permanent capital loss and the erosion of purchasing power over
            time.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>We are willing to look wrong in the short run to be right over the long run.</li>
            <li>We avoid leverage at the portfolio level.</li>
            <li>We prefer simplicity over complexity wherever possible.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="muted small">
            We pair fundamental analysis with quantitative tools to understand
            downside scenarios, position sizing, and portfolio resilience.
